## Backend

CoolSave uses a dedicated backend for sensors, food management, and recipe generation:

[CoolSave_API](https://github.com/andreicosmin02/CoolSave_API)

Ensure your backend is running locally or remotely and the environment variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set accordingly.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the app:**

    ```
    npx expo start
    ```

3. **Environment setup:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root:

    ```
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/
    ```

    Adjust the URL based on your backend location.
